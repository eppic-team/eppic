# The EPPIC config file

##################
# Basic config 
##################

# For evolutionary analysis to be performed (option -s) minimum requirements
# are blastable dbs, blast binaries directory and clustalo binary

# BLAST local databases (indexed with formatdb)
# Use UniRef100 for best results
# The directory where the formatdb files reside, the basename of 
# the files is then given with BLAST_DB parameter 
BLAST_DB_DIR=/data/dbs/uniprot/current
# The blast db must be formatted with formatdb
BLAST_DB=uniref100.fasta

# The blast+ blastp executable
BLASTP_BIN=/usr/bin/blastp

# The blastclust executable from the blast legacy package
BLASTCLUST_BIN=/opt/packages/blast/bin/blastclust
# Directory of the blast legacy distribution where the blast data files (blosum matrices) are stored
# needed for blastclust
BLAST_DATA_DIR=/opt/packages/blast/data
		
# Path to the alignment program executable file, 
# one (and only one) of t_coffee or clustalo has to be set
#TCOFFEE_BIN=/usr/bin/t_coffee
CLUSTALO_BIN=/usr/bin/clustalo

# Path to the PyMOL executable file (needed for option -l only)
# PyMOL version must be 1.5+ (needs to support reading of pdb.gz files)
PYMOL_EXE=/usr/bin/pymol

# Passing PDB codes with -i will only work if these parameters are set
# Path to the local rsynced PDB mmCIF files directory (compressed .gz files)
LOCAL_CIF_DIR=/data/dbs/pdb/data/structures/all/mmCIF/
# Alternatively the same path from PDB's ftp
#PDB_FTP_CIF_URL=
# If this is set to true then mmCIF files will be retrieved online 
# (PDB_FTP_CIF_URL parameter above), if false from local CIF dir (LOCAL_CIF_DIR 
# parameter above)
#USE_ONLINE_PDB=false
	
# Path to the SIFTS file (PDB to UniProt mapping)		
#SIFTS_FILE=
# If SIFTS_FILE unset then it will be retrieved from uniprot's FTP server
# unless USE_SIFTS is set to false, which will force no SIFTS to be used
# and always use blast to find the PDB to UniProt mapping.
#USE_SIFTS=true
