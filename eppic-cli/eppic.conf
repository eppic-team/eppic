# Basic config 
##################

# For evolutionary analysis to be performed (option -s) minimum requirements
# are blastable dbs, blast binaries directory and clustalo binary

# BLAST+ local databases (indexed with makeblastdb)
# Use UniRef100 for best results
# The directory where the makeblastdb files reside, the basename of 
# the files is then given with BLAST_DB parameter. 
BLAST_DB_DIR=/data/dbs/uniprot/current
# The BLAST+ db must be formatted with makeblastdb
BLAST_DB=uniref100.fasta

# The BLAST+ blastp executable
BLASTP_BIN=/usr/bin/blastp

# The mmseqs2 executable, for redundancy reduction via sequence clustering
MMSEQS_BIN=/usr/bin/mmseqs2
		
# Path to the alignment program executable file 
CLUSTALO_BIN=/usr/bin/clustalo

# Path to the PyMOL executable file (needed for option -l only)
# PyMOL version must be 1.5+ (needs to support reading of cif.gz files)
PYMOL_EXE=/usr/bin/pymol

# Path to the Graphviz dot command (needed for option -l only)
GRAPHVIZ_EXE=/usr/bin/dot

# Passing PDB codes with -i will only work if these parameters are set
# Path where mmCIF files will be cached locally,
# can also be set through environment variable PDB_DIR. The layout of the
# directory will mirror the PDB ftp.
ATOM_CACHE_PATH=/data/dbs/pdb
# Fetch behavior for AtomCache, valid values:
#  FETCH_IF_OUTDATED: use local file, download only if it is newer than local,
#                     behavior similar to rsync
#  FETCH_FILES: download from server or use local if file present, don't check
#               for updated 
#  FORCE_DOWNLOAD: for every file force download from the server 
FETCH_BEHAVIOR=FETCH_IF_OUTDATED
# An optional URL to a different repository than the standard http PDB repository
# as available via BioJava.
# Use full path to cif.gz file with {middle} and {id} placeholders
# e.g. http://myserver.org/divided/{middle}/{id}.cif.gz
# The placeholders are replaced by lower case PDB id and lower case middle 2-letter hash.
#CIF_REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE_URL=
	
# Path to the csv SIFTS file (PDB to UniProt mapping)
#SIFTS_FILE=
# If SIFTS_FILE unset then it will be retrieved from uniprot's FTP server
# unless USE_SIFTS is set to false, which will force no SIFTS to be used
# and always use blast to find the PDB to UniProt mapping.
