    <title>New Scripting Engine</title>
    <para>
      The scripting engine has been completely rewritten for Jmol Release
      6. As of this writing it should be considered *alpha test* code. Please
      supply feedback in case of bugs and/or unexpected behavior and/or
      with feature requests. You can do this through the jmol home
      page <ulink url="http://jmol.sourceforge.net" />

  <para>
    Jmol supports the RasMol scripting language defined by RasMol. 
    Information about RasMol can be found
    at <ulink url="http://www.openrasmol.org/" />.
    The current URL for full RasMol documentation
    is: <ulink url="http://www.openrasmol.org/doc/rasmol.htm" />.

  <para>
    The Chime web browser plug-in was based upon the RasMol source code.
    Various extensions were added, including additional scripting
    commands. Information about Chime can be found
    at <ulink url="http://www.mdlchime.com/" />
    The current URL for extended chime scripting commands
    is: <ulink url="http://www.mdlchime.com/chime/chimerasmol.html" />.

  <para>
    Jmol currently supports many of the RasMol/Chime scripting commands. Our
    goal is to eventually provide full script support. This will provide
    a migration path for those who wish to move to an open source solution
    that supports a larger number of file formats on a wider variety of
    hardware platforms.

  <para>
    Please give us feedback on what features you use and that are currently
    no implemented. This will help us prioritize future development.
