The source code for versions of RasMol up through 2.6 is in the public domain. See:
http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/faq_ras.htm#pubdom

http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/srccode.htm

In addition, the Jmol project has explicit permission from Roger A Sayle to make use
of RasMol source code up through 2.6.*

The OpenRasMol project http://www.openrasmol.org, starts with 2.7.* annd has different
licensing restrictions that are not currently compatible with Gnu licensing terms.

Certainly, please feel free to read, re-use, re-code, whatever, any of
the source code contained in RasMol versions up to and including v2.6.x.
 All of these release of RasMol were distributed as "public domain",
i.e. free from any intellectual property rights claims
whatsoever.  Indeed this is the legal reason why the source code
could become part of MDL's Chime and MSI's WebLab viewer products.

No problem.  I hope this helps.
