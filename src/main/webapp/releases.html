		<h1>Release log</h1>

		<h2>2.0.4 - 17th January 2014</h2>

		<ul class="eppic-iframe-log-list">
			<li>Major user interface change: upgraded to GXT 3.0.1, new top
				navigation bar, improved "My Jobs" panel, nicer fonts and much more</li>
			<li>New homologs information pop-up window providing details on
				the identity distribution and taxonomy of each homolog used in the
				MSA</li>
			<li>Introduced interface clustering. A button on top of the
				interfaces table now triggers a cluster view of equivalent
				interfaces</li>
			<li>New FAQ and Publications pages. Improved and expanded Help page</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>2.0.3 - 27th November 2013</h2>

		<ul class="eppic-iframe-log-list">
			<li>Improvements in top panel: now split into experimental info
				panel and sequence info panel. Also some improvements in residue
				details window: scores are now better displayed</li>
			<li>Cleaned up the input page: only alignment parameters can now
				be modified in advanced input</li>
			<li>Issues with windows and tooltips displaying badly in IE are
				now gone thanks to GXT 2.3</li>
			<li>Warnings for low resolution or high R-free added</li>
			<li>Interfaces below 35 Ã…<sup>2</sup> are not displayed anymore
			</li>
			<li>Fixed issue in interfaces calculation: the interface search
				extends now to more distant cells, missing interfaces in structures
				such as 1was will now appear</li>
			<li>A few bug fixes</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>2.0.2 - 22nd August 2013</h2>

		<ul class="eppic-iframe-log-list">
			<li>Precomputed EPPIC results are now available for the whole
				PDB, after typing a PDB code the results will appear immediately</li>
			<li>Now operators displayed as symmetry icons with the algebraic
				operators in tooltips. Operators colored in red to mark infinite
				interfaces</li>
			<li>A few bug fixes. In particular issue with crashes in parsing
				PDB files having no TER records (or badly placed ones) is now fixed
			</li>
			<li>The static pages are now fully crawlable by search engines</li>
			<li>Some style improvements</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>2.0.1 - 19th April 2013</h2>

		<ul class="eppic-iframe-log-list">
			<li>Fixed displaying problems in residue details table, the ugly
				white frames disappeared</li>
			<li>Now the homologs panel in top panel contains links to
				download the colored-by-entropies PSE files produced by the EPPIC
				command line program. Very useful to get a visual impression of the
				conservation of residues at the surface of the structure. This shows
				graphically why EPPIC works</li>
			<li>Better handling of UniProt reference mapping, especially for
				multi-segment mappings</li>
			<li>More warnings added: unreliability of surface residues
				(surface residues not aligning to UniProt reference), if too many
				then NOPRED call is given</li>
			<li>Display and style improvements</li>
			<li>A few bug fixes</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>2.0.0 - 15th February 2013</h2>

		<ul class="eppic-iframe-log-list">
			<li>First full public release</li>
			<li>Cofactors of more than 40 non-Hydrogen atoms are now taken
				into account. They will be considered as part of the protomers in
				ASA calculations. This affects especially predictions in small
				proteins with large cofactors like hemoglobin</li>
			<li>PDB residue numbers are now used for warning messages and
				output jmol, pdb and pse files</li>
			<li>The missing eppic.conf file is now provided in downloadable
				eppic.zip</li>
			<li>The guessing of file types is now more flexible, it will
				allow PDB files starting with: HEADER, TITLE, COMPND, SOURCE,
				EXPDTA, REMARK, DBREF, SEQRES, CRYST1, MODEL, HELIX, SHEET. Any
				other file not starting with one of these lines will be rejected</li>
			<li>Blast results are now precomputed for all PDB entries which
				makes runs for deposited PDBs a lot faster</li>
			<li>The web session will now expire after 24 hours of
				inactivity. The "My Jobs" list will then be lost</li>
			<li>Style improvements</li>
			<li>Many bug fixes, especially in relation to parsing PDB and
				mmCIF files</li>

		</ul>




		<h2>1.9.6 - 22nd December 2012</h2>

		<ul class="eppic-iframe-log-list">
			<li>First public pre-release</li>
