		<h2>Downloading data in XML format</h2>
		<p>
			From version 2.1.0 on, it is possible to download the results data in XML format
			which can then be parsed and used for further analysis. 
			Simply click on the "Download XML" link in any result page and you will get the XML data.
			You will just need to use this kind of URL:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/dataDownload?type=xml&amp;id=PDB_code</code>
		</p>
		<p> 
			for precomputed PDB entries. Several PDB codes (comma-separated) are also allowed for the id
			parameter. For your own uploaded files you will have to use:			
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/dataDownload?type=xml&amp;id=My_job_id</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			where you need to give your long alphanumeric job id. 
			Please note that we have download limits per IP. If you need to do bulk 
			downloads, please contact us. We can then place an exception for you.
		</p>

		<h2>Software and source code</h2>

		<p>
			The EPPIC web server is a web GUI to the EPPIC command line program,
			written in Java. The latest version of it is available <a
				href="../downloads/eppic.zip">here</a>. If you need to run it often
			or want to tweak the parameters we recommend that you use the command
			line version. It has been tested in Linux only but it should work
			also in MacOSX. <a
				href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download"
				target="_blank">Blast</a> and <a
				href="http://www.clustal.org/omega/" target="_blank">Clustal
				Omega</a> are required for it to work.
		</p>
		<p>			
			You will need Java 7 (or newer) to be able to run the command-line EPPIC
			program. The program also uses the  
			<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/remotingAPI/" target="_blank">UniProt	JAPI</a>,
			which you will need to download separately.
		</p>
		<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/eppic-team/eppic" target="_blank">available</a> 
			under the GPL license. You can get it with the following GIT command:</p>

		<p>
			<code> git clone https://github.com/eppic-team/eppic </code>
		</p>

		<p>
			EPPIC uses as well the open source <a
				href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/owl" target="_blank">OWL
				java library</a> for structural bioinformatics.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please <a href="mailto:eppic@systemsx.ch">contact</a> us if you have
			problems with it or if you want to send any kind of feedback.
		</p>
			
		<h2>EPPIC Interface Loader plug-in for PyMOL</h2>

		<p>
			The EPPIC Interface Loader plug-in for PyMOL allows 
			direct download of precalculated EPPIC interfaces into PyMOL. It works in Linux, Windows and Mac.
			To request a specific interface (according to EPPIC numbering) just type a PDB code 
			followed by a dash and by the interface number in the plug-in dialog window.
			To request all EPPIC interfaces for that entry, just input the PDB code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interfaces are displayed by default as lines; by typing a PDB code followed by a dash, 
			interface number, another dash and a chain ID (e.g.: 2trx-1-A) the interface will 
			be shown in hybrid mode. In this mode the chain given in the input will be shown as 
			sequence entropy-mapped surface and its interface partner will appear as cartoon.
			The latest version of the plugin is available <a
				href="../downloads/pymol_plugin.zip">here</a>. 			
		</p>

		<h2>Datasets</h2>

		<p>
			The datasets used for developing the EPPIC method (see the <a
				href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334" target="_blank">paper</a>)
			can be downloaded as plain text files:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/DCxtal.txt"  target="_blank">DCxtal set</a>: a set of
				crystal contacts with large interface areas (&gt;1000Å<sup>2</sup>)
			</li>
			<li><a href="../downloads/DCbio.txt"  target="_blank">DCbio set</a>: a set of
				biologically relevant interfaces with relatively small interface
				areas (&lt;2000Å<sup>2</sup>)</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			The area distributions of the DCxtal and DCbio interfaces, as seen in
			<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334/figure/F1"
				target="_blank">this plot</a>, overlap substantially. This is a
			distinctive feature of the sets, as crystal interfaces tend to be
			small and biologically relevant ones tend to be large. Also note that
			all entries in the sets are selected for crystallographic quality by
			resolution and Rfree filtering.
		</p>

		<p>The files contain lists of PDB codes with lists of interface
			identifiers as calculated by EPPIC, i.e. id 1 corresponding to
			largest interface in crystal, and increasing ids for smaller
			interfaces. If no interface id is given in a line then interface 1 is
			implied. Lines starting with "#" are comments.</p>

		<p>
			We recently compiled (see <a
				href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/13/21" target="_blank">paper</a>)
			a new dataset of experimentally validated transmembrane protein
			oligomeric structures. It can also be downloaded as text file here:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/TMPbio.txt"  target="_blank">TMPbio set</a>: a set of
				biological interfaces spanning the transmembrane region, from both
				alpha and beta TMP subclasses</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Please note that the original publications also contain the datasets including 
			our full annotations. However we cannot update those if we find any mistakes.
			The downloadable datasets here represent the most up-to-date and best
			validated sets. Please use these ones preferentially to the ones available in the 
			original publications.
		</p>
		<p>
			For completeness this is a full changelog of any mistakes that we have found 
			since publication:
			
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			DCbio set: 3f3e was removed because it is a membrane protein and additionally the experimental evidence 
			was not sufficiently clear; 1ytq was removed because it has a clear domain swap
			</li>
		</ul>
