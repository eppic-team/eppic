		<h2>Software and source code</h2>

		<p>
			The EPPIC web server is a web GUI to the EPPIC command line program,
			written in Java. The latest version of it is available <a
				href="../downloads/eppic.zip">here</a>. If you need to run it often
			or want to tweak the parameters we recommend that you use the command
			line version. It has been tested in Linux only but it should work
			also in MacOSX. <a
				href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download"
				target="_blank">Blast</a> and <a
				href="http://www.clustal.org/omega/" target="_blank">Clustal
				Omega</a> are required for it to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please beware that since UniProt release 2013_09 the <a
				href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/remotingAPI/" target="_blank">UniProt
				JAPI</a> (used by EPPIC) requires java 7 to run. Thus from September
			2013 you will need java 7 to be able to run the command-line EPPIC
			program.
		</p>
		<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/eppic-team/eppic" target="_blank">available</a> under the GPL license. You can get
			it with the following GIT command:</p>

		<p>
			<code> git clone https://github.com/eppic-team/eppic </code>
		</p>

		<p>
			EPPIC uses as well the open source <a
				href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/owl" target="_blank">OWL
				java library</a> for structural bioinformatics.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please <a href="mailto:eppic@systemsx.ch">contact</a> us if you have
			problems with it or if you want to send any kind of feedback.

		<h2>EPPIC Interface Loader plug-in for PyMOL</h2>

		<p>
			The EPPIC Interface Loader plug-in for PyMOL (works in Linux, Mac and Windows) allows 
			direct download of precalculated EPPIC interfaces into PyMOL. 
			To request a specific interface (according to EPPIC numbering) just type a PDB code 
			followed by a dash and by the interface number in the plug-in dialog window.
			To request all EPPIC interfaces for that entry, just input the PDB code.
			Interfaces are displayed by default as lines; by typing a PDB code followed by a dash, 
			interface number, another dash and a chain ID [example: 2trx-1-A] the interface will 
			be shown in hybrid mode. In this mode the chain given in the input will be shown as 
			sequence entropy-mapped surface and its interface partner will appear as cartoon.
			The latest version of it is available <a
				href="../downloads/pymol_plugin.zip">here</a>. 			
		</p>

		<h2>Datasets</h2>

		<p>
			The datasets used for developing the EPPIC method (see the <a
				href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334" target="_blank">paper</a>)
			can be downloaded as plain text files:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/DCxtal.txt"  target="_blank">DCxtal set</a>: a set of
				crystal contacts with large interface areas (&gt;1000Å<sup>2</sup>)
			</li>
			<li><a href="../downloads/DCbio.txt"  target="_blank">DCbio set</a>: a set of
				biologically relevant interfaces with relatively small interface
				areas (&lt;2000Å<sup>2</sup>)</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			The area distributions of the DCxtal and DCbio interfaces, as seen in
			<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334/figure/F1"
				target="_blank">this plot</a>, overlap substantially. This is a
			distinctive feature of the sets, as crystal interfaces tend to be
			small and biologically relevant ones tend to be large. Also note that
			all entries in the sets are selected for crystallographic quality by
			resolution and Rfree filtering.
		</p>

		<p>The files contain lists of PDB codes with lists of interface
			identifiers as calculated by EPPIC, i.e. id 1 corresponding to
			largest interface in crystal, and increasing ids for smaller
			interfaces. If no interface id is given in a line then interface 1 is
			implied. Lines starting with "#" are comments.</p>

		<p>
			We recently compiled (see <a
				href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/13/21" target="_blank">paper</a>)
			a new dataset of experimentally validated transmembrane protein
			oligomeric structures. It can also be downloaded as text file here:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/TMPbio.txt"  target="_blank">TMPbio set</a>: a set of
				biological interfaces spanning the transmembrane region, from both
				alpha and beta TMP subclasses</li>
		</ul>
