		<h2>Downloading data in XML format</h2>
		<p>
			From version 2.1.0 on, it is possible to download the results data in XML format
			which can then be parsed and used for further analysis.
			Simply click on the "Download XML" link in any result page and you will get the XML data.
			You will just need to use this kind of URL:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/dataDownload?type=xml&amp;id=&lt;PDB_code&gt;</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			for precomputed PDB entries. Several PDB codes (comma-separated) are also allowed for the id
			parameter. For your own uploaded files you will have to use:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/dataDownload?type=xml&amp;id=&lt;My_job_id&gt;</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			where you need to give your long alphanumeric job id.
			Individual interfaces can be requested by using an underscore after the PDB code, e.g.:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/dataDownload?type=xml&amp;id=1smt_1</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			will give you interface 1 of PDB 1smt.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that we have download limits per IP. If you need to do bulk
			downloads, please contact us. We can then place an exception for you.
		</p>

		<h2>Downloading mmCIF files of interfaces or assemblies</h2>
		<p>
			Downloads of individual mmCIF files per interface is also possible by using the following URL:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/fileDownload?type=interface&amp;id=&lt;PDB_code&gt;&amp;interfaceId=&lt;Interface_id&gt;&amp;coordsFormat=cif</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			For assemblies mmCIF file the URL is:
			<p>
				<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/fileDownload?type=assembly&amp;id=&lt;PDB_code&gt;&amp;assemblyId=&lt;Assembly_id&gt;&amp;coordsFormat=cif</code>
			</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that the server uses gzip encoding. Thus if you use wget, you will need the following syntax:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>wget --header="accept-encoding: gzip" "http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/fileDownload?type=interface&amp;id=&lt;PDB_code&gt;&amp;interfaceId=&lt;Interface_id&gt;&amp;coordsFormat=cif"
			-O PDB_code_Interface_id.pdb.gz</code>
		</p>
		<p>
			The interface ids are those calculated by EPPIC from largest (1) to smallest (n). The assembly ids
			are sorted from lower stoichiometries to higher stoichiometries.
			Note that the downloaded mmCIF files have the b-factors column replaced
			by the corresponding sequence entropy values per residue. Chains that are transformed
			with a rotation operator (symmetry partners) are named with &lt;original_chain_id&gt;_&lt;operator_id&gt;.
		</p>

		<h2>Downloading Multiple Sequence Alignments</h2>
		<p>
			It is also possible to download the precomputed PDB-wide Multiple Sequence Alignments on which the evolutionary calculations
			are based. You will need to provide the PDB identifier and the chain identifier of the first chain in an entity (each of the unique
			sequences in a PDB entry):
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/fileDownload?type=msa&id=&lt;PDB_code&gt;&repChainId=&lt;Chain_Id&gt;</code>
		</p>

		<h2>Software and source code</h2>

		<p>
			The EPPIC web server is a web GUI to the EPPIC command line program,
			written in Java. The latest version of it is available <a
				href="../downloads/eppic.zip">here</a>. If you need to run it often
			or want to tweak the parameters we recommend that you use the command
			line version. It has been tested in Linux only but it should work
			also in MacOSX. <a
				href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download"
				target="_blank">Blast</a> and <a
				href="http://www.clustal.org/omega/" target="_blank">Clustal
				Omega</a> are required for it to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will need Java 8 (or newer) to be able to run the command-line EPPIC
			program. The program also uses the
			<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/remotingAPI/" target="_blank">UniProt	JAPI</a>,
			which you will need to download separately.
		</p>
		<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/eppic-team/eppic" target="_blank">available</a>
			under the GPL license. You can get it with the following GIT command:</p>

		<p>
			<code> git clone https://github.com/eppic-team/eppic </code>
		</p>

		<p>
			EPPIC uses as well the open source <a
				href="http://www.biojava.org" target="_blank">BioJava</a> library.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please <a href="mailto:eppic@systemsx.ch">contact</a> us if you have
			problems with it or if you want to send any kind of feedback.
		</p>

		<h2>EPPIC Interface Loader plug-in for PyMOL</h2>

		<p>
			The EPPIC Interface Loader plug-in for PyMOL allows direct
			download of precalculated EPPIC interfaces into PyMOL. It works in
			Linux, Windows and Mac. Entering a PDB code will load all interfaces
			for that PDB entry. Single interfaces can also be selected.
			Interfaces are numbered according to the EPPIC website. By default,
			each interface is loaded as its own object. They can also be loaded
			as multiple states in a single object, which can then be navigated
			using the state navigation at the bottom right.
		</p>
		<p>
			Interfaces are displayed by default with the two molecules in "lines"
			representation. One can otherwise choose to show the molecules in
			surface representation with sequence entropies color-coded onto it.
			The latest version of the plugin is available <a
				href="../downloads/pymol_plugin.zip">here</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Datasets</h2>

		<p>
			The datasets used for developing the EPPIC method (see the <a
				href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334" target="_blank">paper</a>)
			can be downloaded as plain text files:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/DCxtal.txt"  target="_blank">DCxtal set</a>: a set of
				crystal contacts with large interface areas (&gt;1000Å<sup>2</sup>)
			</li>
			<li><a href="../downloads/DCbio.txt"  target="_blank">DCbio set</a>: a set of
				biologically relevant interfaces with relatively small interface
				areas (&lt;2000Å<sup>2</sup>)</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			The area distributions of the DCxtal and DCbio interfaces, as seen in
			<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334/figure/F1"
				target="_blank">this plot</a>, overlap substantially. This is a
			distinctive feature of the sets, as crystal interfaces tend to be
			small and biologically relevant ones tend to be large. Also note that
			all entries in the sets are selected for crystallographic quality by
			resolution and Rfree filtering.
		</p>

		<p>The files contain lists of PDB codes with lists of interface
			identifiers as calculated by EPPIC, i.e. id 1 corresponding to
			largest interface in crystal, and increasing ids for smaller
			interfaces. If no interface id is given in a line then interface 1 is
			implied. Lines starting with "#" are comments.</p>

		<p>
			We further compiled (see <a
				href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/13/21" target="_blank">paper</a>)
			a new dataset of experimentally validated transmembrane protein
			oligomeric structures. It can also be downloaded as text file here:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/TMPbio.txt"  target="_blank">TMPbio set</a>: a set of
				biological interfaces spanning the transmembrane region, from both
				alpha and beta TMP subclasses</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			We next automatically obtained two large-scale datasets of crystal and biological
			contacts, called XtalMany and BioMany, respectively
			(<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/14/22" target="_blank">Baskaran et al. 2014</a>),
			which contain nearly 3000 entries each. XtalMany is based on the concept of operators
			leading to infinite assemblies. BioMany is mainly based on the concept of shared interfaces
			across crystal forms: it is a subset of <a href="http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/protcid/" target="_blank">ProtCID</a>
			from the Dunbrack group with very stringent	parameters.
			In addition it contains interfaces from dimeric structures that were solved both
			by crystallography and NMR: here the idea is that an NMR dimer validates the dimeric biounit
			of the corresponding crystal structure.
			XtalMany and BioMany can be downloaded as text files here:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/ManyXtal.txt"  target="_blank">XtalMany set</a>: a large
				dataset of crystal contacts</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="../downloads/ManyBio.txt"  target="_blank">BioMany set</a>: a large
				dataset of biological interfaces</li>
		</ul>



		<p>
			Please note that the original publications also contain the datasets including
			our full annotations. However we cannot update those if we find any mistakes.
			The downloadable datasets here represent the most up-to-date and best
			validated sets. Please use these ones preferentially to the ones available in the
			original publications.
		</p>
		<p>
			For completeness this is a full changelog of any mistakes that we have found
			since publication:

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			DCbio set: 3f3e was removed because it is a membrane protein and additionally the experimental evidence
			was not sufficiently clear; 1ytq was removed because it has a clear domain swap
			</li>
			<li>
			TMPbio set: the relevant interface for 2wsw is 2, as listed in the publication. The downloadable dataset
			file has been corrected accordingly
			</li>
		</ul>
