			<h4>EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein-Protein Interface Classifier)
				aims at classifying the interfaces present in protein crystal
				structures in order to determine whether they are biologically
				relevant or not.</h4>

			<p>In addition to that, it provides information of general use
				for a number of structural biology applications:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Precomputed Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) of closely
					related homologs (within 60% sequence identity)for every protein in
					the PDB or for user-uploaded structures</li>
				<li>Colored-by-sequence-entropy surface representation as PSE
					files. Very useful for looking at features present at protein
					surfaces: interfaces, binding sites etc. (<a
					href="#homologs-window">more</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Number and distribution of core residues in interfaces</li>
				<li>Symmetry features of interfaces: the crystallographic
					operators generating each interface are provided and are depicted
					in red if they are conducive to infinite assemblies. Also, one can
					compare the left- and right-hand side of the Details table of each
					interface to see if it is <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous" target="_blank">isologous</a>
					or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"
					target="_blank">heterologous</a>

			<div class="eppic-help-subtopic-left-big">
				<p>You can submit your protein structure by uploading a
					PDB/mmCIF file or by typing a PDB code. We have precalculated
					results PDB-wide using the default parameters. If you upload your own
					file, this triggers a calculation that can take several minutes
					depending on the structure.</p>

				<p>When you upload a file, the various input parameters can be changed via the Advanced
					tab in the input page. You have the following options:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Identity soft cut-off:</strong> The soft sequence
						identity cut-off for BLAST hits to be used in the alignment. If
						there are not enough sequences at this cut-off then the threshold
						is relaxed until the hard cut-off is reached.</li>
					<li><strong>Identity hard cut-off:</strong> The hard sequence
						identity cut-off for BLAST hits to be used in the alignment. If
						there are not enough sequences at soft cut-off then the threshold
						is relaxed until this hard cut-off.</li>
					<li><strong>Max num of sequences:</strong> The maximum number
						of sequences to be taken from the BLAST hits.</li>
					<li><strong>Search Mode:</strong> The PDB sequence is first
						matched to its UniProt entry and that sequence is then used for
						blasting. In Global mode the full length UniProt is used, in local
						only the matching PDB part of the UniProt sequence is used.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Every new job run on the server is assigned a unique job
					identifier, a long alphanumerical string that is only known by the
					user who submits it and that is very hard to guess. This keeps the
					privacy of your data (<a href="#job-identifiers">more</a>).

		<!-- Main Interface table -->
		<h2 id="interface-table">The main interface table</h2>
		<p>EPPIC will provide a view of all the protein-protein interfaces
			present in the crystal and assess their biological or crystal contact
			nature based on a geometrical and on two evolutionary criteria:
		<ul>
			<li><b>geometry</b>: number of core residues (at <b>95%
					burial</b>), indicating how good the packing in the interface is</li>
			<li><b>core-rim score</b>: ratio of evolutionary signal
				(sequence entropy) of core residues (at <b>70% burial</b>) versus
				rim residues</li>
			<li><b>core-surface score</b>: a score (z-score like) of
				sequence entropy of core residues (at <b>70% burial</b>) versus
				random samples of other surface residues</li>
		</ul>


		<div class="eppic-help-subtopic">
			<div class="eppic-help-subtopic-left-small">
				<img class="eppic-help-subtopic-image"
					src="resources/images/screenshots/interface-table.png"
					title="Screenshot of the main interface table"></img>
			</div>
			<div class="eppic-help-subtopic-right-big">

				<p>Each of these indicators casts a vote based on predefined
					score thresholds. The possible calls are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><font color="green">BIO</font>, the interface is
						biologically relevant</li>
					<li><font color="red">XTAL</font>, the interface is only a
						crystal lattice contact</li>
					<li>NOPRED, there is not enough information available to make
						a decision (usually not enough sequence data)</li>
				</ul>



				<p>
					You can see the actual scores for each of the indicators by
					hovering the mouse pointer over the bio/xtal/nopred labels.
					Warnings may appear on the right side of the interfaces table
					marked by the icon <img src="resources/icons/warning_icon.png"
						style="vertical-align: middle"></img>. By hovering the mouse over
					the icon, one can see different issues for which the prediction
					should be taken with care, e.g. engineered residues at the
					interface core or rim, metal ions mediating the interface, atom
					clashes in the interface etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					From the three votes a final decision is made ("Final" column). <font
						color="green">BIO</font> will mean that a majority of the criteria
					indicated a biological interface and likewise for <font color="red">XTAL</font>.
					This is the final prediction column and what you need to look at
					first.
				</p>



				<p>The other columns in the interface table correspond to a few
					important parameters describing the interfaces: the two chain codes
					of the partners (e.g. "A+B"), the Buried Surface Area upon
					interface formation (interface sorting is based on this value), the
					icon of the crystal operator used to generate the second partner of
					the interface and the number of core residues on each side of the
					interface (e.g. "4+5").</p>
				<p>
					The operators are represented as icons to show at a glance what
					kind of crystallographic symmetry is present at the interface. The
					actual full algebraic operator (e.g. "-X+1,Y-1/2,-Z") can still be
					seen by hovering the mouse over the icon. The icons used for the
					operators are mostly the standard ones found in crystallographic
					tables: <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_AU.png"></img> the identity operator
					(i.e. an interface in the asymmetric unit), <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_XT.png"></img> a crystal translation
					(integer) without rotation, <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_FT.png"></img> a re-centering
					translation without rotation, <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_2.png"></img> a 2-fold axis, <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_2S.png"></img> a 2-fold screw axis, <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img" src="resources/icons/optype_3.png"></img>
					a 3-fold axis, <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_3S.png"></img> a 3-fold screw axis, <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img" src="resources/icons/optype_4.png"></img>
					a 4-fold axis, <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_4S.png"></img> a 4-fold screw axis, <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img" src="resources/icons/optype_6.png"></img>
					a 6-fold axis, <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_6S.png"></img> a 6-fold screw axis.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the rare cases where a protein is crystallized in non-chiral
					space groups (e.g. racemic mixtures) there are additional
					operators: <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_-1.png"></img> an inversion centre, <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_-2.png"></img> a mirror plane, <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_GL.png"></img> a glide plane, <img
						class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_-3.png"></img> an improper 3-fold
					axis, <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_-4.png"></img> an improper 4-fold
					axis, <img class="eppic-iframe-optype-img"
						src="resources/icons/optype_-6.png"></img> an improper 6-fold
					axis.
				</p>
				<p>Some of these operators lead to formation of infinite
					interfaces if occurring between two crystallographically-related
					copies of the same molecule (e.g. A+A). This happens for both the
					pure translations and for any of the screw rotations and it is
					generally a very strong indication of a crystal contact. In those
					cases we color the operator icon in red. In any case our final call
					ignores this at the moment but we might use that information in
					future versions.</p>

		<h3>Clustering similar interfaces</h3>
		<div class="eppic-help-subtopic">
			<div class="eppic-help-subtopic-left-big">


				<p>Clusters of similar interfaces can be shown by checking the
					"Group similar interfaces" box. This ensures that interfaces
					within 2&#197; RMSD from each other will be clustered together. For
					each cluster, a header row displays a thumbnail representation of
					all member interfaces, while a bottom row reports the number
					of contributing interfaces and their average area. Additionally
					for each of the scores an average is calculated and a call
					produced based on these averaged scores. This should provide a better
					prediction than individual interface scores, since the possible 
					differences between the chains are averaged out.</p>

		<h2 id="3D">Viewing interfaces in 3D</h2>
		<div class="eppic-help-subtopic">
			<div class="eppic-help-subtopic-left-small">
				<img class="eppic-help-subtopic-image"
					src="resources/images/pse-withsurface-verysmall.png"
					title="3D view of interface as it would appear in PyMOL using the pse mode">
			</div>

			<div class="eppic-help-subtopic-right-big">
				<p>The thumbnails in the Interface table give a visual cartoon
					representation of the interfaces. By clicking on them one gets an
					interactive 3D view, depending on the selected mode: as browser
					embedded Jmol viewer (no need for local viewer), as a PDB file
					downloadable to a local molecular viewer, or as PyMOL session file
					(.pse) to be opened in local PyMOL. In both Jmol and pse modes the
					two protomers are represented as cartoons with interface residues
					also shown as sticks. Core residues from both protomers are shown
					in two different shades of red.</p>
				<p>The PSE mode is particularly useful as it is already prepared
					with selections of the different parts of the interface and nicely
					depicted. The entropy values for each residue are written as
					b-factors in the .pdb and .pse files so one can use the PyMOL
					"color by b-factor" functionality (spectrum command) to show the
					selection pressure pattern mapped on the 3-dimensional structure:
					blue colors indicate low entropies and colors toward reds
					correspond to increasingly higher entropies. The surface
					representation is particularly helpful here in order to see surface
					residues only.</p>
				<h3>Changing 3D-Viewing mode:</h3>
				<p>The 3D-Viewer can be changed using the button "Change 3D
					Viewer" on the top-left corner of the main interface table.
					Clicking the button will open a drop-down menu where one
					can select any one of the three modes described above.</p>

		<h2 id="information-panel">Experimental and sequence information

			The top panel is subdivided into two subpanels: <b>Experimental
				Information</b> on the left and <b>Sequence Information</b> on the

		<img class="eppic-help-subtopic-image-no-animation"
			src="resources/images/screenshots/information-panel.png"
			title="Screenshot of information panel"></img>
		<p>
			The <b>Sequence Information</b> panel contains information about the
			sequences and their homologs. There is a line for each of the
			distinct protein sequences present in the protein structure. If too
			many chains are present, arrows will appear on the left of the panel
			to navigate to other chains. Each line displays 4 items some of which
			are followed by <img src="resources/icons/info_icon.png"></img> icon.
			Clicking this icon reveals more information about the item adjacent
			to it. The items are explained below:

			<div class="eppic-help-subtopic-left-big">

				<ol>
					<li><b>Chain identifier(s)</b>: the first letter is the chain
						identifier of the representative sequence. This letter can be

						UniProt sequence (based on <a

						A link to the reference UniProt record is provided on the top,
						as well as the organism to which the entry belongs.</li>
					<li><b>Number of homologs</b>: whenever fewer than 10 homologs
						are found you will see a NOPRED call in the evolutionary predictor
						columns (core-rim and core-surface), indicating that the MSA is
						too small for a proper decision to be reached. The more sequences
						in the alignment the more reliable the evolutionary predictions
						will be, so looking at this number is important. Click on the <img

		<h3>UniProt database version</h3>
		<p>
			The header of the <b>Sequence Information</b> panel shows which
			version of the UniProt database version is used to find homologs for
			the EPPIC multiple sequence alignments. A new UniProt database
			release appears every month containing more and more sequences, in
			fact the growth is exponential thanks to new sequencing technologies
			(growth statistics can be seen <a
				href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/TrEMBLstats/" target="_blank">here</a>).
			With more sequences we can obtain better predictions (see this <a
				href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334/figure/F6"
				target="_blank">figure</a>), thus the growth of the UniProt sequence
			database has quite an important effect on the accuracy of our method.
			We will try to maintain the results as up-to-date as possible and to
			update the PDB-wide precomputed results every month (for every
			UniProt update). In any case if you use our results <strong>it
				is important to quote the UniProt database version used</strong>.

				<p>The homologs information window provides number, identity
					distribution and coverage of the sequence homologs in the MSA used
					for entropy calculation. This information is given for all unique
					chains in the structure. Coverage is depicted with colored segments
					within a rectangle corresponding to the query sequence length.
					Identity is color-coded in quantized bins, with green representing
					higher identity and red lower identity. The exact percentage of
					identity is also provided near the bar. The last two columns in the
					table provide the taxonomy of the homolog. More details of the
					sequence of a particular homolog can be found by clicking the
					UniProt link in the first column of the table. Clicking on the 
					links provided on the Genus names will open their corresponding 
					Wikipedia pages.
				<p>
				<p>
					In the header one can find information about the query sequence and
					the identity threshold used. Together with that, the clustering
					threshold for redundancy elimination is also indicated: sequences
					are clustered so that no pair of sequences are more similar than
					this value. The link in the top-right corner of the window enables
					you to download the MSA of all homolog sequences (FASTA format).
					You will need an alignment viewer like <a
						href="http://www.jalview.org/" target="_blank">Jalview</a> to have
					it nicely displayed.
					Additionally cliking on the icon with the colored molecule will download
					a PyMOL session file (.pse file) where the molecule is shown in surface 
					representation with the sequence entropy values from the MSA color-mapped 
					onto it. This is particularly useful in order to get a visual impression of
					the selection pressure patterns on the surface of a given
					chain. The spectrum function of PyMOL is used to color the
					residues: highest conservation is denoted by blue, transitioning
					to yellow and orange for lower conservation values. Residues that
					could not be aligned (for instance because they belong to an
					engineered tag) appear in red. Magenta dots mark the
					core residues of the largest interface in which the chain
					participates. PyMOL selections are also available in the PSE file
					to let one select interfaces other than the default (largest) one.

					for each side of the interface (the chain identifiers corresponding
					to the two sides are shown at the top). Below each chain
					identifier, score details are provided. Underneath those, a table
					(residue table) gives per-residue information.</p>
				<p>
					Score details are shown on top of the two grids for each side of the
					interface: number of core residues at 70% burial (i.e. the core
					residues used for calculating the evolutionary scores), number of 
					rim residues (i.e. all other interface residues), core-rim 
					score and core-surface score.
				</p>
				<p>By default, the two residue tables show only interface residues. To
					see all residues of the two chains one needs to switch the view in
					the drop down menu in the upper right corner of the window.</p>
				<p>The first two columns of the residue tables are the residue
					numbers: "Serial" for the numbering based on the SEQRES
					sequence from 1 to n, "PDB Serial" for the numbering as it appears
					on the ATOM lines of the PDB file. Four pieces of information are
					given for each residue: total accessible surface area (ASA), total
					buried surface area (BSA) upon interface formation, ratio of burial
					(BSA/ASA) upon interface formation (core/rim assignments are based
					on this) and sequence entropy value from the MSA of homologs to the
					query sequence. More information about the homologs and alignments
					can be found on the Top Panel.</p>
				<p>
					At the bottom of the window a legend shows the color coding used
					for the residue tables. Dark red denotes core residues at <b>95%
						burial</b>, which are used for the geometry prediction. Lighter red
					corresponds to core residues at <b>70% burial</b>, used for
					evolutionary core-rim and core-surface predictions. Light blue is
					used for all other interface residues, white for non-interface
					surface residues and grey for fully buried (protein interior)
					residues.

		<h2 id="known-issues">Known issues</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
			<b>MTRIXn records not used</b>: for some PDB entries, usually viral capsid proteins, extra 
			operators are required for reconstructing the full Asymmetric Unit. At the moment
			EPPIC does not take these operators into account. This results in missing interfaces for
			those structures (e.g. 
			<a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1AUY" target="_blank">1auy</a>, 
			<a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3RA2" target="_blank">3ra2</a>). 
			This applies also to a few non-capsid entries like 
			<a href="http://www.pdb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1A37" target="_blank">1a37</a>.  
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>MHC and antibody interfaces not correctly predicted</b>: due to the special nature 
			of the MHC and antibodies sequences, the evolutionary criteria used by EPPIC do not hold 
			for them. Thus the predictions for interfaces with at least one MHC or antibody molecule 
			will often be incorrect.

		<h3 id="job-identifiers">Job identifiers</h3>
		<p>
			Every new job run on the server is assigned a unique job identifier,
			a long alphanumerical string that is only known by the user that
			submits it and that is very hard to guess. It is recommended that you
			give an email address while submitting so that you receive the URL
			with the job identifier in your inbox. Otherwise you will have to
			bookmark it or keep a record of it yourself. It is always possible to
			retrieve the job by using the URL
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#id/&lt;my_job_id&gt;</code>
			. Whether the job is still running or already done, the URL will show
			its current status and automatically display the final results
			whenever it is finished. To share the results of a job with
			colleagues just send them the corresponding URL. The jobs will be
			stored in our servers for 1 month and then deleted.
		</p>
		<p>The PDB-wide precomputed results can be accessed directly by
			using the permanent URLs:</p>
		<p>
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#id/&lt;PDB_code&gt;</code>
		</p>

		<h3 id="low-resolution">Low resolution and high R-Free warnings</h3>
		<p>If the X-ray resolution of a PDB entry is lower than 3.5 Å, a
			low resolution warning will appear in red next to the structure title
			on top. Whenever this happens one should treat all results with
			caution, since our predictions depend on accurate side chain
			positioning to calculate burial and assign interface core residues. A
			warning also appears in case the R-Free factor is higher than 35%.</p>


		<h3 id="download-results">Downloading results in XML format</h3>
		<p>By clicking the "Download XML" link below the main title in the 
			Top Panel, one gets an XML file containing all the information 
			about interfaces and scoring (including the MSA) for the structure
			being analyzed. This is useful for further data processing. XML
			downloads of precomputed PDB entries can be scripted by using URLs like:
			<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/ewui/dataDownload?type=xml&amp;id=PDB_code</code>.
			See the <a href="http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#downloads" onclick="reloadPage('http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#downloads');">Downloads page</a> for more information.
		</p>

		<h3 id="assembly-note">A note on assemblies</h3>
		<p>
			At the moment EPPIC classifies only pairwise interfaces in protein
			crystals. It does not consider interfaces in the context of the full
			biological assembly and does not group single interface calls into a
			biological unit call. We intend to implement that in future versions
			of the software. In the meantime please keep in mind that some
			interfaces may be called <font color="red">XTAL</font> when they are
			actually <font color="green">BIO</font> if considered in the context
			of the assembly: they are "induced" by the topology or point-group
			symmetry of the assembly.
