  <title>Web Server configuration for the JmolApplet</title>
  <para>
    The JmolApplet is configured on the web server just like any other
    Java applet.
  </para>
  <para>
    The JmolApplet.jar and Jmol.js files are placed in a directory
    on your web server.
    We advise placing them in a sibling directory or subdirectory of
    your .html pages ... something like <command>../jmol</command>
    or <command>./jmol</command>
  </para>
  <para>
    All the java classes needed by the applet are contained in the single
    JmolApplet.jar file. 
  </para>
  <para>
    The applet runs as an unsigned/untrusted applet. Therefore, no additional
    steps are needed for end-user verification of applet authenticity.
