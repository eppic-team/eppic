			<h1>EPPIC - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h2>General</h2>
			<h4>What does EPPIC stand for?</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>E</strong>volutionary <strong>P</strong>rotein-<strong>P</strong>rotein
				<strong>I</strong>nterface <strong>C</strong>lassifier.
			</p>
			<h4>What can I use EPPIC for?</h4>
			<p>EPPIC mainly aims at classifying the interfaces present in
				protein crystal lattices in order to determine whether they are
				biologically relevant or not. In addition to that it provides
				information of general use for a number of structural biology
				applications:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Precomputed Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) of closely
					related homologs (within 60% sequence identity) for every protein in
					the PDB or for user-uploaded structures</li>
				<li>Colored-by-sequence-entropy surface representation as PSE
					files. Very useful for looking at features present at protein
					surfaces: interfaces, binding sites etc.</li>
				<li>Number and distribution of core residues in interfaces</li>
				<li>Symmetry features of interfaces: the crystallographic
					operators generating each interface are provided and are depicted
					in red if they are conducive to infinite assemblies. Also, one can
					compare the left- and right-hand side of the Details table of each
					interface to see if it is <a
					href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous" target="_blank">isologous</a>
					or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterologous"
					target="_blank">heterologous</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>How should I cite EPPIC?</h4>
			<p>
				The main paper describing the EPPIC method is <a
					href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334"
					target="_blank"> Duarte JM, Srebniak A, Schaerer MA, Capitani
					G, BMC Bioinformatics 2012</a>. As well as citing the paper it is
				important that one cites the <strong>EPPIC software version</strong>
				(top right below the logo in results page) and even more important
				the <strong>UniProt database version</strong> (monthly releases)
				used for the evolutionary analysis. Our predictions depend on the
				sequence homologs found by searching the UniProt database so with
				every release of the database the predictions can change. UniProt is
				growing very fast these days so a few months of UniProt releases
				between two runs can make a difference.
			</p>
			<h4>How do I know if a prediction is reliable? Does EPPIC
				produce confidence values?</h4>
			<p>EPPIC does not produce confidence values for its prediction at
				the moment, though we plan to have them. In any case there are a few
				things that one can look at to understand if the prediction can be
				trusted or not:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The more sequence homologs the better: look at the number
					of homologs on the Sequence Information panel on top. If it is
					below 10 we will not even produce the evolutionary scores and the
					prediction will be purely geometrical (less reliable). If it is
					above 10 but not much larger than that one should be careful with
					the results.</li>
				<li>The sequence homologs should span a wide range of
					identities: look at their distribution by clicking on the <img
					src="resources/icons/info_icon.png"></img> icon next to the number
					of homologs. A typical case is that of some microbial proteins
					where only very close sequence homologs exist (&gt;90%) and then
					nothing else is found in sequence databases until &lt;40% identity.
					The resulting alignment will contain less information, thus the
					prediction will be less reliable.
				</li>
				<li>The stronger the consensus the better: if the three
					indicators are unanimous in their calls the prediction can be
					considered more reliable.</li>
				<li>Non full-length proteins (domains or fragments) are less
					reliably predicted: you can find out whether your protein is
					full-length or not by clicking on the <img
					src="resources/icons/info_icon.png"></img> icon next to the chain
					name in the Sequence Information panel.
				</li>
				<li>Check for any kind of warnings: low resolution or R-free
					warnings on top and various per-interface warnings in the last
					column of the Main Interface table. This latter category
					encompasses engineering artifacts (mutations, expression tags),
					possible artifactual mediating ions, engineered disulfide bridges
					etc. If any of these warnings appear one should always treat the
					results with more care.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<h4>What are the advanced input parameters for?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Identity soft cut-off:</strong> The soft sequence
					identity cut-off for BLAST hits to be used in the alignment. If
					there are not enough sequences at this cut-off then the threshold
					is relaxed until the hard cut-off is reached.</li>
				<li><strong>Identity hard cut-off:</strong> The hard sequence
					identity cut-off for BLAST hits to be used in the alignment. If
					there are not enough sequences at soft cut-off then the threshold
					is relaxed until this hard cut-off.</li>
				<li><strong>Max num of sequences:</strong> The maximum number
					of sequences to be taken from the BLAST hits.</li>
				<li><strong>Search Mode:</strong> The PDB sequence is first
					matched to its UniProt entry and that sequence is then used for
					blasting. In Global mode the full length UniProt is used, in local
					only the matching PDB part of the UniProt sequence is used.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Do I need to change the input parameters?</h4>
			<p>
				We don't recommend that the users change these parameters. We have
				used as default values the optimal ones found by benchmarking the
				method on validated datasets of biological interfaces and crystal
				contacts. Our precomputed results for PDB entries use always these
				defaults. A possible scenario where one would want to try other
				parameters is in the case of lack of sequence data within the
				default identity cut-offs. Predictions based on MSAs of too few
				sequences (&lt;10 as a rule of thumb) are not reliable. Lowering the
				identity cut-off will find more sequences, but can at the same time
				introduce problems in the alignment and potentially affect the
				accuracy of predictions (see this <a
					href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334/figure/F5"
					target="_blank">figure</a>)
			</p>
			<h4>If I change the input parameters and submit a PDB
				structure by typing its PDB code, why does it start calculating?</h4>
			<p>We have PDB-wide results precalculated for our users. We use
				only the default parameters for this calculation. If you use any
				parameters other than the default ones, this triggers a calculation
				that can take several minutes depending on the structure.</p>
			<h4>When submitting my own PDB/mmCIF file, can I later access
				the results for the job?</h4>
			<p>
				Every new job run on the server is assigned a unique job identifier,
				a long alpha numerical string that is only known by the user that
				submits it and that is very hard to guess. It is recommended that
				you give an email address while submitting so that you receive the
				URL with the job identifier in your inbox. Otherwise you will have
				to bookmark it or keep a record of it yourself. It is always
				possible to retrieve the job by using the URL
				<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#id/&lt;my_job_id&gt;</code>
				. Whether the job is still running or already done, the URL will
				show its current status and automatically display the final results
				whenever it is finished. You can even share the URL with colleagues.
				The jobs will be stored in our servers for at least 1 month.
			</p>
			<h4>Can I directly link to the precomputed results for a PDB
				entry?</h4>
			<p>
				The PDB-wide precomputed results can be accessed directly by using
				the permanent URLs:
				<code>http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#id/&lt;PDB_code&gt;</code>
			</p>
			<h4>What does the UniProt version on the home page indicate?</h4>
			<p>The UniProt version (e.g. 2013_11) on the homepage denotes the
				UniProt version used to calculate the results of EPPIC. UniProt is
				used to blast for homologs of the input structure, which are then
				used to calculate entropy scores. These homologs can also slightly
				change from one version of UniProt to the next (monthly releases),
				so the results can vary over time. The UniProt version used for a
				calculation is also provided in the header of the Sequence
				Information panel in the results page.</p>
			<h4>What does the version below the EPPIC logo in results page
				indicate?</h4>
			<p>We always keep improving EPPIC with bug-fixes and new
				features. The number displayed below the logo indicates the version
				of EPPIC used to calculate the results. To find out what has changed
				in various versions, please refer to our Release Log page.</p>
			<h4>Where can I get the sequence entropy information?</h4>
			<p>
				A surface representation of each chain color coded by sequence
				entropy can be downloaded from the icon in the sequence information
				panel. This icon is adjacent to the homologs information icon. The
				downloadable file is in PSE format, which can be visualized with <a
					href="http://www.pymol.org" target="_blank">PyMol</a>. The actual
				entropy values can be found in the Residue Details tables (opened
				when clicking on the Details button in the Main Interface table).
			</p>
			<h4>What is the "Change 3D Viewer" option above the interface table for?</h4>
			<p>EPPIC lets one visualize the interfaces in 3D. By clicking on
				the thumbnails in the interface table one gets this interactive 3D
				view. 3D Viewer window allows you to change the type of viewer. The
				available options are: browser embedded Jmol viewer (no need for
				local viewer), a PDB file downloadable to a local molecular viewer,
				or PyMOL session file (.pse) to be opened in local PyMOL.</p>

			<h4>Does EPPIC work on membrane proteins?</h4>
			<p>
				Yes, we tested its performance on a validated dataset of membrane
				protein oligomerization interfaces and it exhibited satisfactory
				accuracy, though below that of soluble proteins. For further details
				see <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/13/21"
					target="_blank"> Duarte JM, Biyani N, Baskaran K, Capitani G, BMC
					Structural Biology 2013</a>.
			</p>
			<h4>Does it work on antibody-antigen interactions?</h4>
			<p>Given the assumptions it rests on for evolutionary analysis,
				EPPIC will not reliably work on antibody-antigen interactions.</p>
			<h4>Does it work on engineered and/or chimeric proteins?</h4>
			<p>EPPIC will tolerate a small number of point mutations compared
				to the reference UniProt sequence and will list them in a warning
				message at the relevant interface(s). If the number of point
				mutations in a certain interface is too high, the evolutionary calls
				will be "nopred". Chimeric proteins will also have "nopred"
				evolutionary calls. Users, however, can edit out of the chimeric PDB
				file the component that is not of interest, thus obtaining
				coordinates that correspond to one sequence only. Those coordinates
				can then be uploaded to EPPIC and be properly analyzed. In any case
				it is not clear whether the evolutionary assumptions that EPPIC
				rests on hold in the case of chimeric proteins. So predictions
				for these cases have to be taken with care.</p>
			<h4>Does it work on multichain NMR structures?</h4>
			<p>We expect EPPIC to work with reasonable accuracy on multichain
				NMR structures and we are currently benchmarking its performance in
				this respect.</p>
			<h4>Does it work on low resolution structures?</h4>
			<p>Predictions based on low resolution structures will be less
				reliable. Indeed if the X-ray resolution of a PDB entry is lower
				than 3.5 Å, a low resolution warning will appear in red next to the
				structure title on top. Whenever this happens one should treat all
				results with caution, since our predictions depend on accurate side
				chain positioning to calculate burial and assign interface core
				residues. A warning also appears in case the R-Free factor is higher
				than 35%. For structures with resolution worse than ~ 4.5 Å the
				results will not be meaningful at all.</p>



			<h2>Method</h2>
			<h4>How does EPPIC work?</h4>
			<p>
				EPPIC relies on sequence evolution and geometry to detect the
				biological character of interfaces. The classifier uses a simple
				geometric measure, number of core residues, and two evolutionary
				indicators based on the sequence entropy of homolog sequences. Both
				aim at detecting differential selection pressure between interface
				core and rim or rest of surface. For further information please
				refer to <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334"
					target="_blank"> Duarte JM, Srebniak A, Schaerer MA, Capitani
					G, BMC Bioinformatics 2012</a>.
			</p>
			<h4>What are core-surface and core-rim scores?</h4>
			<p>Core-surface and core-rim scores are the ones which rely on
				evolution to predict the biological nature of an interface. They are
				calculated as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>core-rim score: </strong>Ratio of evolutionary
					signal (sequence entropy) of core residues (at 70% burial) versus
					rim residues</li>
				<li><strong>core-surface score: </strong>A score (z-score like)
					of sequence entropy of core residues (at 70% burial) versus random
					samples of other surface residues</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The scores are translated to calls using their cut-off values:
				if the calculated score is below its cut-off value the call is XTAL
				or BIO otherwise.</p>
			<h4>What does nopred in interface table refer to?</h4>
			<p>The nopred (no prediction) call can occur when there is not
				enough information available for EPPIC to reach a decision (usually
				not enough sequence data).</p>
			<h4>What do the core sizes in the interface table indicate?</h4>
			<p>Number of core residues (at 95% burial) in each interface,
				indicating how good the interface packing is.</p>
			<h4>What is the difference between core-geometry and
				core-evolutionary residues?</h4>
			<p>Core-geometry residues are core residues at 95% burial and
				core-evolutionary are the core residues at 70% burial. To calculate
				the geometry score, cores at 95% burial are used and to calculate
				evolutionary scores, cores at 70% burial are used.</p>
			<h4>How is the final call predicted?</h4>
			<p>The final call is the consensus call from the evolution and
				geometry calls.</p>
