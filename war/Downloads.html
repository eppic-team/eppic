<h1>
Software and source code
</h1>

<p>
The EPPIC web server is a web GUI to the EPPIC command line program, written in Java. The latest 
version of it is available <a href="../downloads/eppic.zip">here</a>. If you need to run it often or want 
to tweak the parameters we recommend that you use the command line version. It has been tested in Linux only
but it should work also in MacOSX. 
<a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download">Blast</a> 
and <a href="http://www.clustal.org/omega/">Clustal Omega</a> are required for it to work.
</p>

<p>
The source code is available under the GPL license. You can get it with the following subversion command:
</p>

<code>
svn co https://systemsx02.ethz.ch/svn/crk/trunk .
</code>

<p>
EPPIC uses as well the open source <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/owl">OWL java library</a> for structural bioinformatics.
</p>

<p>
Please <a href="mailto:eppic@systemsx.ch">contact</a> us if you have problems with it or if you want 
to send any kind of feedback.

Datasets
</h1>

<p>
The datasets used for developing the EPPIC method (see the 
<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334/abstract">paper</a>)
can be downloaded as plain text files:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="../downloads/DCxtal.txt">DCxtal set</a>: a set of crystal contacts with large interface 
areas (&gt;1000Å<sup>2</sup>)
</li>
<li>
<a href="../downloads/DCbio.txt">DCbio set</a>: a set of biologically relevant interfaces with 
relatively small interface areas (&lt;2000Å<sup>2</sup>)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The area distributions of the DCxtal and DCbio interfaces, as seen in  
<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/334/figure/F1">this plot</a>, 
overlap substantially. This is a distinctive feature of the sets, as crystal interfaces tend to be 
small and biologically relevant ones tend to be large. 
Also note that all entries in the sets are selected for crystallographic quality by resolution and Rfree filtering.
</p> 

<p>
The files contain lists of PDB codes with lists of interface identifiers as calculated by EPPIC, i.e. id 1 corresponding 
to largest interface in crystal, and increasing ids for smaller interfaces. If no interface id is given in a line then 
interface 1 is implied. Lines starting with "#" are comments.
