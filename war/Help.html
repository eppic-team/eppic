The SERVER_NAME service aims at classifying the interfaces present in protein crystal structures in order to determine whether they are biologically relevant or not.
</p>
<p>
After submitting your protein structure as a PDB/mmCIF file or typing a PDB code you will get a view of all the protein-protein interfaces present in the crystal. We assess them based on 3 criteria:
<ul>
<li>
geometry: indicating how good is the packing in the interface
</li>
<li>
ratio of evolutionary signal of core residues versus rim residues
</li>
<li>
z-score of evolutionary signal of core residues versus random samples of rest of surface residues
</li>
</ul>
From these 3 criteria a final decision is made ("Final" column). BIO will mean that both evolutionary (if available) and geometrical evidence indicate that the interface is biologically relevant. Otherwise the interface is called CRYSTAL.
</p>
<p>
The interfaces are described by a few important parameters: the two chain codes of the partners, the Buried Surface Area upon formation (sorting is based on this value) and the crystal operator used to generate the second partner of the interface.
</p>
<p>
Additionally the thumbnails give a visual cartoon representation of the interfaces. By cliking on them one gets an interactive 3D view, depending on selected mode: as browser embedded Jmol viewer (no need for local viewer), as a PDB file downloadable to a local molecular viewer, or as PyMol session file (.pse) to be opened in local PyMol. The pse mode is particularly useful as it is prepared with selections of the different parts of the interface and nicely depicted.
