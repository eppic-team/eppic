EPPIC

Evolutionary Protein-Protein Interface Classifier

http://www.eppic-web.org



USAGE

Use 'eppic -h' to obtain help about the available command line options for 
eppic. A typical run would be:

eppic -i 1smt.pdb -s

That will first calculate all interfaces present in the given PDB file,
then find homologs in UniProt by using BLAST and finally align them to 
produce evolutionary scores (core-rim score and core-surface score) for all
interfaces found. The geometry scores will also be output.

Many output files are produced. The most important ones are the .scores 
files containing the scoring for the 3 indicators and for the combined 
consensus calls:
  
  1smt.geometry.scores    -  The geometry scores
  1smt.corerim.scores     -  The core-rim scores
  1smt.coresurface.scores -  The core-surface scores
  1smt.combined.scores    -  The combined scores and calls (bio/xtal)

Also interesting are the sequence-related files, one per chain (the chain 
code e.g. 'A' is used for the extension):

  1smt.A.aln              -  The alignment of the homolog sequences and query
  1smt.A.entropies        -  The entropy values for each of the query's 
                             positions
  1smt.A.log              -  The list of homologs used with some taxonomy info
  
Additionally some PDB files per interface are produced (interface identified 
by a serial number from 1 to n going from largest interface to smallest).

  1smt.1.pdb              -  The structure of interface 1: first partner of 
                             interface is in the original PDB file position, 
                             second partner is the one transformed with a 
                             crystal operator (unless it is in asymmetric 
                             unit).
                             The entropy values per residue are encoded as 
                             b-factors (useful for PyMOL coloring) 

Note that more structure files can be produced per interface by running with 
the -l switch: PyMOL session files (pse), PyMOL script files (pml), thumbnail 
png images of interfaces, etc.



INSTALLATION

        EPPIC is a java program that should work in any Unix like system. 
        It has only been tested in Linux but there is no reason why it should
        not work in MacOSX.
        
        You need Java 1.6 or newer. Most systems will have java already 
        installed. Otherwise get it by installing the OpenJDK package in 
        Linux or downloading java from http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp


        1. Prerequisites:
        
           As minimum prerequisites you will need:
        
           - The UniRef100 database downloadable from UniProt 
             (http://www.uniprot.org/downloads), formatted for blasting with 
             formatdb.
           
           - Blast+ binaries, downloadable from 
             http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download

           - Blastclust binary found in legacy blast package, downloadable from 
             http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download
             
           - Clustalo (recommended) or T-coffee binary, downloadable from
             http://www.clustal.org/omega/
             http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects_home_page/t_coffee_home_page.html
             
           - The UniProt JAPI, downloadable from
             http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/remotingAPI/download/uniprotjapi.jar 
             

        2. Configuring it: 
           
           - Unzip the eppic.zip file. This will produce an eppic directory with 
             a few files in it (including this README).
             
           - Copy the downloaded uniprotjapi.jar to the eppic directory.
           
           - Copy the eppic.conf file provided to your home directory with the 
             name .eppic.conf. Edit it and set the parameters:
           
              BLAST_DB_DIR
              BLAST_DB
              BLASTCLUST_BIN
              BLASTP_BIN
              CLUSTALO_BIN or TCOFFEE_BIN
           
             to their appropriate paths. 
             Optionally you can also set PYMOL_EXE (needed for -l option) and 
             LOCAL_CIF_DIR (needed to provide PDB codes with -i). 


        3. Now you can run eppic:
           
           ./eppic
           
           In order to run it from anywhere in your system you will need to
           add the directory containing it to your path or simply add an alias
           to your .bashrc:
           
           alias eppic='/path/to/unpacked/eppic/eppic'
