INSTALLATION

        EPPIC is a java program that should work in any Unix like system. 
        It has only been tested in Linux but there is no reason why it should
        not work in MacOSX.
        
        You need Java 1.6 or newer. Most systems will have java already 
        installed. Otherwise get it by installing the OpenJDK package in 
        Linux or downloading java from http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp


        1. Prerequisites:
        
           As minimum prerequisites you will need:
        
           - The UniRef100 database downloadable from UniProt 
             (http://www.uniprot.org/downloads), formatted for blasting with 
             formatdb.
           
           - Blast binaries, downloadable from 
             http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download
             
           - T-coffee binary, downloadable from
             http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects_home_page/t_coffee_home_page.html
             
           - The UniProt JAPI, downloadable from
             http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/remotingAPI/download/uniprotjapi.jar 
             

        2. Configuring it: 
           
           - Unzip the eppic.zip file. This will produce an eppic directory with 
             a few files in it (including this README).
             
           - Copy the downloaded uniprotjapi.jar to the eppic directory.
           
           - Copy the eppic.conf file provided to your home directory with the 
             name .eppic.conf. Edit it and set the parameters:
           
              BLAST_DB_DIR
              BLAST_DB
              BLAST_BIN_DIR
              TCOFFEE_BIN
           
             To their appropriate paths. 
             Optionally you can also set PYMOL_EXE (needed for -l option) and 
             LOCAL_CIF_DIR (needed to provide PDB codes with -i). 


        3. Now you can run eppic:
           
           ./eppic
           
           In order to run it from anywhere in your system you will need to
           add the directory containing it to your path or simply add an alias
           to your .bashrc:
           
           alias eppic='/path/to/unpacked/eppic/eppic'
